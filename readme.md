Manage strings across languages effortlessly using utility commands:

```shell
yarn lang add
yarn lang remove
yarn lang search
yarn lang update
```

## â€¢ Building the Application

To build the APK, ensure you have Node.js, NPM, and Apache Cordova installed on your device. Use Cordova CLI to build the application.
